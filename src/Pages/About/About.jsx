            It was 470 years ago, at the dawn of the new age when the the lands of Val-oria first shook, and a great mass of land rose into to the heavens. With it, it took one of the lands great cities, now only known to us as "The Lost".  Over the next 60 years nine more times the land shook and nine more times was a great piece of the surface torn from the ground. The Sky Lands, as they have come to be known cast a dark shadow upon the land, disrupting the kingdoms farms and trade.  Some say dark things happen in their shadows, whispers of an evil not before known to our world.  Times have shifted and much of the world has grown used to the Sky Lands looming on the horizon.  Superstition keeps folk from venturing out in the times of shadow, and from time to time those who have, have gone missing.  Reports around the realm speak of odd folk, and strange creatures making themselves known in places once thought to be safe from dark things.  The High King, Arthur Coldemian, of the Kings City has made a call out to the great cities of the land,  "Our great land has seen enough of the despair brought by these lands of abomination.  Midgraad, calls out to any who would aid in discovering what secrets they hold.  and perhaps a solution to their existence as well.  If you wish to return this call, make way to the Kings City and present this letter to the guard.  Make haste, and may the Gods, whichever you serve, be in your favor." You have come across this pamphlet containing the message in a manner of your own making, and have decided, for whatever reasons you have, to answer the call.
